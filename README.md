# R package `dataprocr2`

This package is for personal use in analyzing the data from www.iquizoo.com. It is different from `dataprocr` package in the way of returning each function. This package will return a `data.frame`.

## Key notes

For historical and personal issues, I have once called these games as tests. This can be misleading in current circumstances, and they will be called *games* from now on, which is most suited now.

## Contributing

Contribution is certainly welcome. But I do think there is something related to commerce, so I think no one will be of interest in contributing. Anyway, issues and PR are both welcome.
